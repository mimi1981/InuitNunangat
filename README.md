A basic page to share our dataset and request feedback on how you would like to use this to address your regional needs


Hi everyone! 

I am a French/Greek London UK based scientist leading a polar group at UCL (Earth Science / Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling) with 10+ years expertise in satellite monitoring and modelling . I was one of the few scientists that took part in the MOSAiC Arctic expedition in 2019/2020. Together with colleagues at UCL (Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction and Institut for Global Health) and and with close links with Inuit and Canadian partners we are proposing a novel and unique satellite based approach to monitor long term changes of the sea ice cover at the global Inuit Nunangat level as well as at the local sub 1km level. We combine state of the art polar remote sensing and modelling with the latest AI techniques and are looking forward to utilise these technologies for the benefit of the local populations and economical prosperity.

We are interested to identify the key synergies between our product and the Inuit Nunangat regional needs in terms of safety, health, transport, etc...
